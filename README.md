##Description
Classification rules as an algorithm has become very popular due to rise in the field of Machine Learning. But users consuming this analysis view it more as a black box with relatively opaque ways to see the results. For instance, the process of generating rules for a dataset often results in hundreds of rules made up of numerous attributes, which are not human readable always. We want to visualize these rules so that they can be better understood by the technical audience, so that they can make more sense out of the rules in a cohesive manner.
